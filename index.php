	<h1>A Brief History of<br><span>Harry Houghton</span></h1>

	<p>To Begin: My name is Henry Houghton, III. This is what I figure it says for my course enrollment information too, in case there is any confusion about the title of this bio. I go by Harry though, and always have! I currently work at Pearson Education in Back Bay, and although I end all of my emails with "Thanks, Harry", most people still call me Henry because that's what how my email address lists me. I am a project manager for creating online course portals for college classes, and although I have been at Pearson for 6+ months and now know how to complete a project, I still end a project unsure what it is I did.</p>
	<p>I went to Brown undergrad and taught English in China for a year and have a Hubway membership (and a helmet, safety first) and I like martinis but still hate olives and I love to visit my sister in London but otherwise miss her and my '96 Corolla was recently broken into but only so the tail lights could be stolen (hot commodity, I guess?) and one of my favorite books is <em>Deliverance</em> by James Dickey &ndash; you should read it.</p>
	<p>Other than that, I'm excited to take this course! I never took much (read: any) computer science courses in college, but I needed to use it periodically in the jobs I've had and really enjoyed it, so I'm trying to keep building my knowledge base. I took Java II with Prof. Henry Leitner last year, good fun. I have no doubt this will be just as fun! Oh and the code editor I'm using is Sublime Text 2, though I'll also occasionally use DreamWeaver if I do any of this while at work (please don't tell).</p>
	<p>There's always more, but that should do well as a small bio. If you need to contact me for any reason, my email address is h.oscar3@gmail.com. Looking forward to the next class!</p>
